    A network-based attack is a type of cyber attack that targets vulnerabilities and weaknesses 
    in computer networks and their components. These attacks focus on exploiting security flaws in 
    network protocols, devices, and infrastructure to gain unauthorized access, disrupt communication, 
    steal information, or carry out other malicious activities. Network-based attacks often occur over 
    the internet or local networks and can affect individuals, organizations, and even critical infrastructure.

<!--DOS Attack-->>
<section class="post_content">

        <h2 id="before">DOS (Denial Of Service) Attack</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>A Denial of Service (DoS)</strong>attack is a type of cyber attack that aims to disrupt the 
            availability of a computer system, network, or service by overwhelming it with a high volume of traffic. 
            The goal of a DoS attack is to make the targeted system or service unavailable to legitimate users, 
            essentially denying them access. DoS attacks can last from a few hours to many months, costing companies and consumers time 
            and money while their resources and services are unavailable.
            <br><br>
            <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>Attackers in these types of attacks typically flood web servers, systems or networks with traffic that overwhelms the victim's resources and makes it difficult or impossible for anyone else to access them.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>DoS and DDoS attacks often take advantage of vulnerabilities in networking protocols and how they handle network traffic. For example, an attacker might overwhelm the service by transmitting many packets to a 
                    vulnerable network service from different Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

        <h2 id="before">Types of DoS attacks</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            DoS and DDoS attacks have a variety of methods of attack. Common types of denial-of-service attacks include the following:
        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="list">
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Application layer</strong></li> These attacks generate fake traffic to internet application servers, especially domain name system (DNS) servers or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) servers. Some application layer DoS attacks flood the target servers with network data; others target the victim's application server or protocol, looking for vulnerabilities.
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>Buffer overflow</strong></li> This type of attack is one that sends more traffic to a network resource than it was designed to handle.
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>DNS amplification</strong></li> In a DNS DoS attack, the attacker generates DNS requests that appear to have originated from an IP address in the targeted network and sends them to misconfigured DNS servers managed by third parties. The amplification occurs as the intermediate DNS servers respond to the fake DNS requests. The responses from intermediate DNS servers to the requests may contain more data than ordinary DNS responses, which requires more resources to process. This can result in legitimate users being denied access to the service.
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>Ping of death</strong></li> These attacks abuse the ping protocol by sending request messages with oversized payloads, causing the target systems to become overwhelmed, to stop responding to legitimate requests for service and to possibly crash the victim's systems.
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>State exhaustion</strong></li> These attacks also known as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) attacks -- occur when an attacker targets the state tables held in firewalls, routers and other network devices and fills them with attack data. When these devices incorporate stateful inspection of network circuits, attackers may be able to fill the state tables by opening more TCP circuits than the victim's system can handle at once, preventing legitimate users from accessing the network resource.
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>SYN flood</strong></li> This attack abuses the TCP handshake protocol by which a client establishes a TCP connection with a server. In a SYN flood attack, the attacker directs a high-volume stream of requests to open TCP connections with the victim server with no intention of completing the circuits. A successful attack can deny legitimate users access to the targeted server.
            <br><br>
            <li><strong>Teardrop</strong></li> These attacks exploit flaws like how older operating systems (OSes) handled fragmented IP packets. The IP specification enables packet fragmentation when the packets are too large to be handled by intermediary routers, and it requires packet fragments to specify fragment offsets. In teardrop attacks, the fragment offsets are set to overlap each other. Hosts running affected OSes are then unable to reassemble the fragments, and the attack can crash the system.

    <div class="container" style="margin: 15px; width: fit-content;">
        <h2 id="before">What is TCP?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite, commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP is responsible for ensuring reliable communication between devices over a network, particularly over the internet.
            <br><br>
            TCP provides a set of rules for how data packets should be exchanged between devices to ensure 
            the integrity, reliability, and orderly delivery of data. It operates at the transport layer of 
            the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is a conceptual 
            framework for understanding how different networking protocols interact.

        <h2 id="before">SQL Injection?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            SQL injection is a type of cyber attack where malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in an application's input validation 
            to execute unauthorized SQL queries. It occurs when user inputs are not properly sanitized before being used in database 
            queries, allowing attackers to manipulate these inputs to gain unauthorized access to the database or perform other malicious 
            actions.

                SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.
                <br>
                SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
                <br>
                SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <h2 id="before">How SQL Injection Works?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        <strong>Input:</strong>Web applications often take user inputs, like forms, search boxes, or URLs, and use them in SQL queries to interact with a database.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Lack of Sanitization:</strong>If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize these inputs, attackers can inject malicious SQL code into them.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Manipulating Queries:</strong> Attackers insert SQL commands into input fields to manipulate the application's SQL queries. This can lead to unintended actions like unauthorized access, data leakage, or even modifying or deleting data.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Suppose a website has a login form:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(232, 232, 236); width: fit-content; margin: 20px; padding: 15px; border-radius: 4px;">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '&lt;input_username&gt;' AND password = '&lt;input_password&gt;';</p>
        <br>
        <p >If the application doesn't sanitize input correctly, an attacker could input ' OR '1'='1 as the username and ' OR '1'='1 as the password. The modified query would become:</p>
        <p style="background-color: rgb(232, 232, 236); width: fit-content; margin: 20px; padding: 15px; border-radius: 4px;">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '' OR '1'='1';</p>

        <p>SQL injection is a serious threat that can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access. Proper input validation, using prepared statements, and staying informed about secure coding practices are crucial for preventing these attacks.</p>
